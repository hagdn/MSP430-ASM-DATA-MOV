# MSP430-ASM-DATA
First chapter of my journey on MSP430:
This chapter is learning about the addressing modes and the way to move 
data from register-register and register-memory vise versa.

Relevance:
Learning these would help me process sensor data, for example, reading a data from a port connected to a sensor
then sending that data to another port or store them into memory.

Objective:
I should be able to move and copy data from register-register or memory-register, as well as memory-memory
at the end of this chapter.
